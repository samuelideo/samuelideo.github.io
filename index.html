                This website is the answer to these questions. My wife and I love playing board games with our 
                family and friends and we want to share with you some basic information of our favorite games.

        <h2>What does "Jogatina" mean?</h2>
        <p>Some years ago, my wife and I started playing board games with a couple friends at our house and we 
            became addicted to these games. We used to get together every week and play games for several hours. 
            We created a group called "Jogatina" which means "Gaming". This website will help you find some good 
            suggestions of board games for adults and kids. It will provide some good reviews of our group's 
            favorite games and some very useful information about them. Board gaming is all about the fun 
            experiences people can create around the table.
