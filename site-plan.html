        Settlers of Catan is a well-established strategy game with a number of different variations available. 
        It revolves around simple resource management and has a board that is constructed afresh each time you 
        play it. We were introduced to Settlers by some friends, and immediately had to buy ourselves a set, 
        as we enjoyed it so much and could see that our family would love it too.

        Tokyo has been besieged by monsters! Revel in this theme-heavy game and use your dice to defeat your 
        opponents to be crowned the King of Tokyo! In King of Tokyo you take on the role of one of six monsters 
        intent on destroying Tokyo, but you don’t share well with others. You have six dice which you’ll roll up 
        to three times each (similar to Yahtzee) that will allow you to attack, refill your life, gain energy, or 
        go for points. When another monster is in Tokyo, you can attack them in an attempt to move into Tokyo. 
        When you’re in Tokyo, you can attack all of your opponents. Of course, what good is being a monster if you 
        can’t have super powers? As the game progresses, you can spend energy to buy power ups to aid in your 
        conquest.

      <p>Create your own journey with Tsuro... the Game of the Path.
        Place a tile and slide your stone along the path created, but take care! Other players’ paths can lead you 
        in the wrong direction—or off the board entirely! Find your way wisely to succeed. The rules are simple: 
        you place a tile to build the next step for your stone to follow. Paths will cross and connect, and the 
        choices you make affect all the journey across the board. Stay the path—your journey begins here.</p>

      <p>We heard your requests… You want more Sushi Go! Well here it is, you got more Sushi Go! This deluxe 
        edition features lots of opportunities to customize your playing experience. You’ll find that while the 
        overall game is basically the same, the variety of cards offers many new opportunities. You’ll also notice
        that the strategy changes from game to game. It's a party platter of mega maki, super sashimi, and endless 
        edamame in this expanded version of the best-selling card game. You still earn points by picking winning sushi
         combos, but now you can customize each game by choosing a la carte from a menu of more than 20 delectable 
         dishes. What’s more, up to 8 players can join in on the sushi-feast… let the good time
