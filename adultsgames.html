        <h2>Settlers of Cattan</h2>
        <p>Settlers of Catan is a strategy game with a number of different variations available. It is a game that 
            involves resource management and has a board that is differently constructed each time you play it. Our 
            friend first played this game in the USA, and introduced it to us and we had to buy ourselves a set, 
            as we enjoyed it so much.

        routes trying to connect different cities in North America.The longer the routes, the more points they earn.
