        <h2>King of Tokyo</h2>
        <p>The city of Tokyo has been attacked by several monsters. And it is up to you to destroy all the other monsters
            and become the King of Tokyo. This is a dice game and it takes some good luck and strategy. You win the game
            whenever you defeat all the other monsters. It is not going to be simple because the other players are trying to
            do the same thing with you. This is a very simple to understand game, very good for kids.
