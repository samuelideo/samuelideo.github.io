        Some years ago, my wife and I started playing board games with a couple friends at our house and we became 
        addicted to these games. We used to get together every week and play games for several hours. We created a 
        group called "Jogatina" which means "Gaming". This website will help you find some good suggestions of board
        games for adults and kids. It will provide some good reviews of our group's favorite games and some very 
        useful information about them. Board gaming is all about the fun experiences people can create around the table.

        Settlers of Catan is a strategy game with a number of different variations available. 
        It is a game that involves resource management and has a board that is differently constructed each time you 
        play it. Our friend first played this game in the USA, and introduced it to us and we had to buy ourselves a set, 
        as we enjoyed it so much.

        <p>You are in charge of one of the 7 great cities of the Ancient World. The main idea is to gather resources, 
          build roads and armies. Build your city and one of the wonders and make your friends jealous of what you built.
          7 Wonders is a simple, addictive, and fun game for the whole family.           </p>

        <p>Ticket to Ride is a fun train adventure game. Players collect train cards to help them build railway
          routes trying to connect different cities in North America.The longer the routes, the more points they earn.
          You can also get some additional points if you are able to fulfill your destination cards by connecting
          two specific cities. This game has won several international game awards and it is my wife's favorite one.

        The city of Tokyo has been attacked by several monsters. And it is up to you to destroy all the other monsters
        and become the King of Tokyo. This is a dice game and it takes some good luck and strategy. You win the game
        whenever you defeat all the other monsters. It is not going to be simple because the other players are trying to
        do the same thing with you. This is a very simple to understand game, very good for kids.

      <p> If you want to be the winner in this game, you will have to destroy all the other players. The rules are simple: 
        you place a tile to build the next step for your stone to follow. Paths will cross and connect, and the 
        choices you make affect all the journey across the board.</p>

      <p>If you and your kids like Japanese food, this game is for you! You are going to try to build the best 
        Japanese Menu. Every time you play this game you will be able to live another completely experience. There are
        different versions of this same game. Kids will enjoy and have lots of fun with it! The cards are super cute
        and the food looks delicious.
